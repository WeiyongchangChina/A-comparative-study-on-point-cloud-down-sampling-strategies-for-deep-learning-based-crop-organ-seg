## Overview

## Dependencies

The code has been tested with Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 14.04.
*  [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
*  h5py



## Data and Model

* Download 3D indoor parsing dataset ([S3DIS Dataset](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDimvNMCGhy_rmBA2gHfDu3naktRm6A8BPwAWWDv-Uhm6Shw/viewform?c=0&w=1)). Version 1.2 of the dataset is used in this work.

``` bash
python collect_indoor3d_data.py
python gen_h5.py
cd data && python generate_input_list.py
cd ..
```

* (optional) Trained model can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UF2nfXdWTOa1iXXmD54_c09rM7pr-kMK).

## Usage

* Compile TF Operators

  Refer to [PointNet++](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2)

* Training
``` bash
cd models/ASIS/
ln -s ../../data .
sh +x train.sh 5
```

* Evaluation
``` bash
python eval_iou_accuracy.py
```

Note: We test on Area5 and train on the rest folds in default. 6 fold CV can be conducted in a similar way.
